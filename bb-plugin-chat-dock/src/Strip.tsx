/**
 * Locked mode. For every chat pane on the page whose right panel is open, a host
 * is appended to the panel's flex column under the tab body (in flow, so the open
 * tab shrinks rather than being covered) and the pane's composer shell moves into
 * it. A collapsed panel, the lock switched off, or leaving the thread puts the
 * shell back. Nothing renders through React: BB owns every element involved.
 *
 * Every check runs from a page-wide mutation observer, so it lands in the same
 * task as BB's own DOM change, before a paint: a shell that mounts with a new
 * thread's column is docked before it is ever drawn in the column, and when BB
 * remounts the panel's column after a plugin setting write, which throws the
 * host out with the shell inside, the host is moved into the fresh column just
 * as invisibly.

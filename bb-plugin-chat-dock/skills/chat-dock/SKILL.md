description: Explain, configure or debug the Chat Dock plugin, which moves BB's composer into the thread's right panel while it is open. Use when the user asks why the composer is or is not in the panel, how to switch between the bottom strip and the Chat tab, how to get the dock button back, or when the composer lands in the wrong place.

# Chat Dock

While a thread's right panel is open, the composer (the box, the cards above it and the chips under it) moves out of the chat column into the panel. BB's own composer is moved, not rebuilt, so the draft and everything inside it come along and go back when the panel closes.

## Modes

- **Keep it at the panel's bottom** (`locked`, on by default): a strip under whichever tab is open; the tab shrinks to make room.
- **Chat tab** (`locked` off): a fixed Chat tab holds the composer while it is the active tab in its pane; otherwise the composer is in the column.

`enabled` switches docking off altogether.

Hiding the right panel (Ctrl+J) puts the composer back in the column in either mode. On a phone-width screen the panel is a drawer and the composer docks at its bottom.

## Settings

The dock button in the composer's action row (beside the microphone) switches `enabled`. Every option is in **Chat dock** in a thread's actions menu (⋯ in the thread header), or use `bb plugin config chat-dock`. All are booleans:

| Key | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | on | Dock the composer in the right panel at all. |
| `locked` | on | Dock as a strip at the panel's bottom; off, as a Chat tab. |
| `showButton` | on | The dock button in the composer. |
| `debugLog` | off | Dock and undock lines in the plugin log. |

BB hides composer actions when the composer is in its compact one-line layout and on phone-width screens, so the button is absent there; use the thread menu or `bb plugin config chat-dock` instead.

## Debugging

Switch on `debugLog`, then `bb plugin logs chat-dock`. Lines: `dock` (`to` strip or tab, the composer's height, `adopted` when the strip took it from the tab), `undock` (`from`, `reason`: panel closed, thread changed, parked for the strip, …) and `rehome` (the strip moved into the panel BB rebuilt after a setting change).

The plugin moves BB's undocumented page elements (`[data-app-composer]`, `#thread-detail-secondary-panel`, `[data-testid=secondary-panel-shelf]`). If the composer stops docking after a BB update, those are the first thing to check.
